export const INSTRUCTIONS = `Sketchy draws hand-sketched, interactive diagrams inside the chat.
You describe structure; Sketchy computes every position. Never pass coordinates.

Fast path: call \`sketch\` once with the whole scene (nodes, edges, groups, parts, wires, labels, steps). Use the small tools (add_box, add_node, add_edge, place_part, connect, label, add_step, …) followed by \`render\` when building incrementally.

Pick one explanation pattern per drawing:
- structure ("what is it made of?"): components as nodes or parts, groups for areas, labels for the important bits. Direction "down" for hierarchies.
- flow ("how does it work / what happens when …?"): a left-to-right chain of nodes and arrows plus one step per stage (add_step) so the user can walk through it.
- comparison ("X vs Y"): one group per option with parallel nodes inside, same order in each group; muted tone for what is equal, accent tone for the key difference.
- metaphor ("explain it simply"): map the unfamiliar thing to an everyday one; one group per side, dashed edges from each real element to its everyday counterpart.

Quality rules:
- 3–12 nodes. Short labels (1–4 words); put details into description (shown on hover).
- Use icons sparingly ("lucide:database", "simple-icons:react") to aid recognition.
- tone "accent" for at most one or two key elements; "muted" for context.
- Steps: 3–7 steps, each highlights the elements that matter in it; text is one or two sentences.

Code → diagram: read the repository yourself, then draw modules as nodes (file = absolute path, so clicking opens it), folders/packages as groups, imports or data flow as edges. Edges point in the direction data or control flows.

Circuits: read the sketch (pinMode, digitalWrite, analogRead, libraries), use search_parts to find part types and pins, place_part each component, then connect pins ("uno.D13" → "led1.A"). Use wire colors: red for power, black for GND, other colors for signals. A resistor in series with every LED.

Photo labeling: find_image → pick a candidate → locate(image, ["USB port", "power jack", …]) → add_image → label(image, region, text) → render. Keep the attribution; it is always shown.`;
